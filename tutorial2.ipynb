    "## Overview\n",
    "Duration: 1min\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to use Doc2Vec to calculate similarity scores between pairs of documents. Doc2Vec is an NLP tool for representing documents as a vector and is a generalizing of the Word2Vec method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, follow the instructions from [README.md](https://github.com/ucals/bettertogether/blob/master/README.md) to get the PDF documents in your local machine. This corpus, which will be located in `pdfs/` folder, contains ~1,000 documents. They are essays written by OMSCS CS-6460 students in Fall 2018 class."
