# Motivation

My first motivation to start this work comes from my personal struggle to form a team to work in OMSCS EdTech final project. In spite of deeply believing that we perform much better when working in teams, I could not successfully form a team. 

After first assignments, I was approached by few of students who read some of my essays, and decided to choose among them after reading their work. This would take some time, but I found it would be worth it. However, as the time passed by, I continued to be approached, and the list of work from potential prospects grew larger: new potential prospects' work, and more work from old potential prospects.

On top of being approached, as by providing feedback to other students, I became very curious about some of them. "I'd love to have time to read their work as well and maybe invite them to work together", I thought. But by then, the list of work to read, to select potential prospects and form a team, was already over 100 documents. How would I find time to read them all? Isn't there a better way?

Then, I started to research Natural Language Processing tools. I'm very interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially NLP: today, AI is solving challenges in several areas that would have been impossible few years ago. To my surprise, I found a lot of great libraries, well written papers and tutorials, and easy-to-use tools (if you are willing to read their documentation, and try/experiment a lot). 

Instead of reading close to 1,000 essays from fellow students (~200 students in class x 5 essays/student), I decided to read a few tutorials, papers and documentation to build a tool to do it for me! Basically, this problem could be solved by calculating similarity score (distance) between pairs of documents. My second motivation was this: learning new NLP techniques, to improve my AI/Machine Learning skills.

Thanks to Doc2Vec from Stanford, Gensim Python library, TextRazor API and several heroes who take the time to help others by publishing their work online for free, 21 hours after the first Google query this app was born.

# Future work

Ranking students with similar interests based on measuring similarity in essay writing is just the beginning. I believe BetterTogether app can be improved in several fronts. We can collect data about personal traits, skill sets, study & work habits, etc, and show students who have same characteristics. Basically we could apply all NLP/AI/ML techniques that big online dating companies are using to match hundreds of millions of couples everyday to solving our problem: helping students navigate the class to find similar people to work in teams, fostering collaboration.
